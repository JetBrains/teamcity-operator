                            When this field is specified, volume binding will only

                            have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when
                            namespace isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both fields
                            (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same

                            There are three important differences between dataSource
                            and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two
                            specific types of objects, dataSourceRef allows any non-core
                            object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While
                            dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them),
                            dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error
                            if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource
                            only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the

                      in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a
                      termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly
                      halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected
                      cleanup time for your process. If this value is nil, the pod's
                      terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                      value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must
                      be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately
                      via the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down). This is a
                      beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod
                      feature gate. Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds
                      is used if unset.
