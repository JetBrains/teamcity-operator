                          objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                          them), dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates
                          an error if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource
                          only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                          in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the

                                  2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports
                                  are not allowed. Currently the port of an Ingress
                                  is implicitly :80 for http and :443 for https. Both
                                  these may change in the future. Incoming requests
                                  are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue.
                                  If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all
                                  traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.
                                  \n host can be \"precise\" which is a domain name
                                  without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g.
                                  \"foo.bar.com\") or \"wildcard\", which is a domain
                                  name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g.
                                  \"*.foo.com\"). The wildcard character '*' must
                                  appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches
                                  only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard
                                  label by itself (e.g. Host == \"*\"). Requests will
                                  be matched against the Host field in the following
                                  way: 1. If host is precise, the request matches
                                  this rule if the http host header is equal to Host.
                                  2. If host is a wildcard, then the request matches
                                  this rule if the http host header is to equal to
                                  the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard
                                  rule."

                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod''s restart policy
                        and the container type. Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always"
                        for the init container will have the following effect: this
                        init container will be continually restarted on exit until
                        all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular containers
                        have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init
                        containers and is often referred to as a "sidecar" container.
                        Although this init container still starts in the init container
                        sequence, it does not wait for the container to complete before
                        proceeding to the next init container. Instead, the next init
                        container starts immediately after this init container is
                        started, or after any startupProbe has successfully completed.'

                            dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them),
                            dataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error
                            if a disallowed value is specified. * While dataSource
                            only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the
